## RW Heat Equation Solver

This project demonstrates how heat naturally spreads over time using a random–walk model of diffusion. The simulation starts with a set of temperature “globs” placed along a one–dimensional line, each representing a small amount of heat. At every time step, these globs move randomly left or right, mimicking the random motion of particles in a material. As they move and mix, sharp temperature differences gradually smooth out, forming the same patterns predicted by the heat equation.  

Through this process, this project shows that diffusion can be understood as the collective result of many tiny random motions. By adjusting the initial temperature distribution and boundary conditions, you can see how heat behaves in different scenarios—such as isolated hot spots spreading symmetrically, walls absorbing or reflecting heat, or noisy profiles becoming smooth over time. The result is an intuitive, visual understanding of how randomness on the microscopic scale produces smooth, predictable behavior on the macroscopic scale.
